ansicolors is a simple Lua function for printing to the console in color.


h1. Installation

Put the file ansicolors.lua somewhere where your Lua interpreter will be able to find it. Then:

<pre>
  local ansicolors = require 'ansicolors'
</pre>

h2. Usage

<pre>
  local colors = require 'ansicolors'
  print(colors('%{red}hello'))
  print(colors('%{redbg}hello%{reset}'))
  print(colors('%{bright red underline}hello'))

  colors.enable(false)
  print(colors('%{red}this is printed plain since coloring is disabled'))
  colors.enable(true)
  print(colors('%{red}this is printed in red again'))
</pre>

The @colors@ function makes sure that color attributes are reset at each end of the generated string. If you want to generate complex strings piece-by-piece, use @colors.noReset@, which works exactly the same, but without adding the reset codes at each end of the string.

h2. Testing

This application uses telescope in order to perform the tests. Install telescope, and then execute
<pre>
  tsc specs/ansicolors_spec.lua
</pre>

Notice that the tests will only work on an ANSI-compatible machine (windows isn't ANSI-compatible)

h2. Windows

Windows console, by default, isn't capable of handling ANSI color codes correctly. This library tries to detect whether it is on a Windows machine (by looking at package.path) and in that case it suppresses all ANSI control characters (the text appears devoid of color, but legible).

By default coloring is disabled on Windows, except if:

* Environment variable @ANSICON@ has been set
* Module @luasystem@ is available and terminal processing has been enabled on @io.stdout@
* It is manually enabled by calling @enable(true)@
